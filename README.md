# Course FAQ

More recent questions will be near the top.  

I am, with permission, very much using much of this wholesale from Patrick Perri's 1631-002 "newsletter". I didn't make a newsletter, because I am a heartless monster.

### Q. What's this course about?

> _A. Designing and developing algorithms: the set of instructions a computer needs to solve a problem. Common tools and techniques will be taught and you will employ them to write computer programs. You  also learn to explain and 'debug' these algorithms._ 

### Q. What programming language does the course use? Why that one?

> _A. Python will be used because it is a high-level programming language which makes it easier to learn than some other languages. Python is also a general purpose language that is commonly used in industry and can support various programming paradigms._ 

### Q. Will the course be in-person or online? Live or asynchronous?

> _A. Unless mandated otherwise, the course will be delivered live and in person._ 

### Q. Is attendance required?

> _A. Live assessments will be held in class for some exercises, the midterm tests and the final exam. Attendance is required for these assessments._ 
> 
> _It is our experience that students that do not regularly attend both the lectures and the lab/tutorial times fall behind significantly, their stress levels are increased and their grades significantly suffer. You are strongly urged to attend all scheduled times._
> 
> _Also, JP likes to track attendance. He finds it useful at the end of the course when students come to ask for bumps across a grade band. Or ask the dreaded "is there anything I can do to pass the course?" question._ 

### Q. Is the textbook required?

> _A. No, but **T. Gaddis, Starting out with Python (5 ed.)**, is recommended. Older, used and electronic editions are fine. If you decide not to buy a text, keep in mind it'll be your responsibility, not mine, to find materials from wherever that are suitable to help your study of the course material._ 

### Q. What kind of computer will I need?

> _A. Strictly speaking: none. You have access to the computing labs (B103, B107, B162, B173, and E203), outside of scheduled lab/tutorial times. If you are working on campus after hours, be sure to sign in with Security._
> 
> _However, if you want to work on your own system at home, we suggest a system over which you have administrative control (to install software) that has a dual-core processor, 4+ GB RAM, access to broadband internet & an updated browser. Any up-to-date OS will be fine._ 

### Q. How is the grade for this course determined?

> _A. Designing and developing algorithms: the set of instructions a computer needs to solve a problem. Common tools and techniques will be taught and you will employ them to write computer programs. You  also learn to explain and 'debug' these algorithms._ 

### Q. What's this course about?

> _A. If you are symptomatic with an infectious disease, stay home and fill in the [Illness Report Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBe2m-8mTIOI6mPtGNGhajTbnBb62QWOEFqd4nIv9gacoacg/viewform). You are responsible for notifying your instructor and should actively communicate with your classmates to get help with what you missed._
> 
> _Without previous arrangement, assignments can be submitted late, but will be penalized 10% per day late._
> 
> _If you know you will be absent in advance, discuss possible arrangements with your instructor. You can ask the department chair to defer a final exam for serious reasons. Obtain that form from the Mathematics and Computing department's administrative assistant Amy McCarthy at amccarthy@mtroyal.ca._
